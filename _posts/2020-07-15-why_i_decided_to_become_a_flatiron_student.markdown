Software Engineering.

The word itself sounds intimidating, let alone the responsibilities and technical difficulties associated with the word. But yet many of us choose to venture into this field to brave the strange and unforgiving land of syntax and semantics it entails, each for our own reasons.

Computers have always been an important part of my life. I grew up as the computer nerd of the family, oftentimes ending up as the de facto tech support guy. There was a certain sense of accomplishment in troubleshooting, especially after many long hours of troubleshooting.

Now I enter a new chapter of my technological journey

Naturally, Iâ€™ve always been interested in coding but, with the limited tools that I had available at the time, I found it impossible to learn and progress and found roadblock after roadblock. And while I was able to eventually troubleshoot issues, I soon realized that troubleshooting wasn't enough. I lacked a fundamental understanding of the language and, as long as this was true, the roadblocks would continue. Here I am years later, finally attacking the problem at its source!

So why did I pursue software engineering? 2 simple reasons really:

(1) I see it as the next step in my technological journey of troubleshooting and creating. 

and

(2) I see it as a gateway, both financially and opportunistic to the rest of the world of tech development.
