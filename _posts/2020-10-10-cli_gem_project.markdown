Honestly I'll start off by saying that, much like my project, this post will likely be much less glamorous than the rest. I'm dissatisfied with the results - and I'm not even sure that it's up to snuff - but I'm glad I took on this assignment. It helped me overcome a lot of the issues I was having and concepts that I was having trouble understanding. 
This was partially attributed to this being my first time using Pry, which really allowed me to get in and see exactly what values my code was returning at key points. This proved crucial as I was having a lot of issues getting information from the API (joke setups and punchlines) to return properly to the users. 
Getting environments set up to begin also gave me issues; it took me an entire day of searching, watching videos and messing with settings.  It seemed like I was doing everything correctly but  just having issues with my specific configuration, so I finally just decided to chalk it and use the LearnIDE. 
Honestly the Learn IDE was very pleasant to use but then again... maybe I was just grateful that I found an IDE that worked on my system. Either way I'll definitely be using it again for future projects.
There is one thing that I do take a little pride in with my code: I don't know how apparent it is but, other than the API file, a lot of my code was heavily improvised/figured on my own just by using pry. Google searches were mainly just to find proper syntax or semantics. This was likely only possible because of the simplicity of my project, but I do feel a little accomplished with myself and that, for the first time in a while, I understand exactly what each individual line of code says.
